I found myself walking beside a woman who felt like family—maybe an aunt, maybe someone else from my childhood—but in the dream these things shift, so for that moment she was my aunt. We walked toward a small roadside shop with a half-closed shutter and dust on its glass pane, as if it had been closed moments ago or months ago—dream logic didn’t care.

We entered carefully. The shopkeeper was nowhere to be seen, yet the counter lights were on. I remember my aunt saying we only needed something small, something inexpensive, like snacks worth 10 or 20 rupees. I found the items effortlessly, as though they appeared just because we intended to buy them.

Then people began to arrive—customers drifting in from the street, stepping into this half-closed shop as if it were completely normal. One man asked for Maggi. I handed it to him and placed the money in a glass jar behind the counter, lowering the shutter slightly as though guarding the store for the absent shopkeeper.

Another customer came with a similar request. I served him too. The shopkeeper eventually returned through a trapdoor-like opening in the floor, carrying bags and tools. The moment he appeared, my aunt began asking him for an egg-tray made of cardboard—something with compartments, something that would hold fragile things safely. After rummaging through old boxes, we found something that suited her.

We stepped outside, and suddenly it wasn’t my aunt beside me anymore—it was my cousin, as if the dream had decided to switch actors mid-scene. I didn’t question it. We sat in a car that felt familiar but also not mine. My phone rang; a friend asked me to meet him somewhere, but I refused, saying I was busy. The dream never explained what “busy” meant.

As we drove, I pointed out a small mountain on the side of the road. Higher up the slope was an enormous old mansion—tall, faded, with pillars that seemed to belong to the 1700s or 1800s. Around it were tiny houses packed tightly together, like a forgotten settlement of workers living under the shadow of a landlord’s estate. My cousin asked about the contrast, and I told her it reminded me of the old world—giant houses of power surrounded by fragile huts.

We stopped near the mountain. I wanted to climb it to watch the sunset. But now my cousin was gone, replaced by a boy—an acquaintance, not quite a friend. We walked upward through levels of stone platforms that functioned like stages. On one level, we saw people from the lowest strata of society sitting together, talking softly. As we climbed higher, the mood shifted. The next group was rowdier—boys clustered as if forming a clique, ready for a fight, their eyes sharp and defensive.

Further up, I saw people with strange skin conditions—blistered textures, bubble-like patterns. It wasn’t frightening, only surreal, as if the mountain sorted people by invisible rules, assigning each level based on some hidden criteria only dreams understood.

We reached a ledge overlooking the horizon. I watched the sun dip behind distant hills, dissolving into deep red and orange bands. When I turned around, the mountain’s opposite slope opened into a channel—nine feet wide, five feet deep—filled with swirling water and trash. Bits of plastic, leaves, and broken objects spun in slow circles. I asked someone where the water came from. He pointed toward the houses and said the waste flowed from them.

On a tree beside the channel, eel-like creatures swam within the murky water. Their bodies glistened under layers of wet debris. When I asked if they were eels, someone nodded casually, as if it were ordinary.

I climbed up again and reached a gate at the top. Passing through it, I found three girls standing in a row. They were human, but something animalistic lingered in their presence—sharp movements, intense staring, an energy I instinctively kept a distance from. They reacted to me with a mixture of curiosity and challenge, but I told them I wasn’t staying and stepped past them.

Behind the gate, the world shifted again. Now the place was filled with monkey-like beings who looked human but moved with agile, animalistic motions. They leapt across thick tree branches that formed a labyrinth overhead. Each branch seemed to represent a rank, a rule, or a privilege. Only certain beings were allowed on certain branches. Their system had structure, hierarchy, and strange etiquette.

I ignored their rules and stepped onto any branch I wished, climbing through their territory. Some glared at me with resentment; others watched silently, uncertain. One of them resembled a friend of mine—a person from earlier in the dream—yet I didn't speak to him. Distance grew between us in silence.

After moving through the branches five or ten times, weaving between their rules, I finally asked them, “Why do these branches matter so much? Why these rules?” The moment I voiced it, the atmosphere shifted. The rules became real—binding—something I now understood was not meant to be broken casually.

The monkey-human creatures became tense, uneasy. I felt their anger rise—not fear for myself, but a recognition that I had crossed a boundary. They started moving toward me, not wildly, but with purpose.

I dropped down from the branches and began running along the ground. The terrain was cluttered with crates and large boxes filled with food—grains, fruits, things I couldn’t recognize. Rats scurried across the dirt. I leapt onto a tall crate, then jumped from one box to another, crossing several of them as though moving through stepping stones.

Each leap carried a sense of height and distance that only dreams allow. On the last box, I saw a kind of food I didn’t recognize—bright, almost glowing. I commented aloud about it, though no one responded.

The threat behind me faded. I wasn’t afraid. I simply felt it was time to head home. The mountain sloped downward, and the path seemed to guide me toward some unseen destination—perhaps home, perhaps waking.

And as I stepped forward, the dream dissolved.

After the dream dissolved into the idea of “home,” I found myself walking on a narrow path that didn’t exist earlier. It curved along the mountain’s spine, bordered by tall grass glowing faintly in the dusk. The mountain no longer looked like a mountain; it had turned into something larger—a ridge stretching endlessly with villages, forests, and structures attached to its sides like drifting memories.

As I walked, I realized the air was colder. Mist settled around my feet, rising in soft swirls. Somewhere behind me, something howled—not an animal, not a human—something between them. The sound traveled strangely, bending around rocks and trees, reaching me from angles that didn’t make sense. I kept walking.

Soon, a cluster of houses appeared. Old, wooden, but maintained with care. Lamps hung outside the doors, flickering with blue fire. People walked around, but their movements were slow, ritualistic, as if they were reenacting actions they had done for centuries. No one noticed me at first.

Then an old man sitting by a stairway looked up.

“You’re late,” he said.

“For what?” I asked.

He didn’t reply. Instead, he pointed to a narrow alley, lit by orange light. The alley felt familiar, though I had never been there in my waking life.

I walked through it.

At the end of the alley, a young woman was sweeping the ground. When she saw me, she paused. Her face looked like someone I knew—someone I might have gone to school with—but her eyes were deeper, older, as if she carried centuries inside them.

“You came from the upper side?” she asked.

“Yes,” I said.

“Then you must be careful. The ones from the branches don’t like when someone breaks their order. They will follow. They always follow.”

Her warning felt like a memory instead of a threat.

I wanted to ask her more, but she simply turned away and continued sweeping. Yet the dust she swept didn’t rise upward—it sank into the ground, disappearing instantly. I realized the village might not obey normal physics at all.

Beyond the alley was a large open courtyard. A massive tree stood in its center—older than anything else here. Its roots twisted above the surface like ancient serpents. People sat around it silently, each holding a clay bowl containing water. Their reflections rippled in the water even though they were perfectly still.

When I stepped closer, the tree reacted.

Leaves rustled though there was no wind. Light shimmered between the branches. A voice—not loud but vast—filled the space:

“Climber of forbidden branches. Breaker of rules.
Do you seek passage or resolution?”

I didn’t know how to answer. But the dream answered for me.

“Passage,” I heard myself say.

The bark of the tree split slowly, like a doorway forming itself out of living wood. A tunnel appeared inside the trunk, glowing faintly.

I stepped in without hesitation.

🌙 PART III — THE ROOT LEVEL

Inside the trunk, I walked downward instead of upward. The roots formed a spiral staircase, and the deeper I went, the more the sound of distant machinery echoed around me. After a few steps, the wood shifted into stone, then into metal, as if I were moving through different eras layered atop one another.

I reached a chamber that felt like a forgotten station. Rusted rails cut across the floor. Lanterns flickered. Posters on the walls showed drawings of mountains, cliffs, and creatures with human eyes.

Someone was sitting on a bench.

It was the boy who had accompanied me earlier—the acquaintance from the mountain. But now he looked calm, older, almost wiser than before.

“You weren’t supposed to come here alone,” he said.

“I didn’t know there was a rule,” I replied.

“That’s the problem,” he said. “Most who come here don’t. And they never go back the same.”

He stood up and pointed toward a massive tunnel carved into the stone.

“They call this the Root Passage. It leads to the base of the mountain—the true base. Not the physical one.”

“What’s there?” I asked.

“The history of this place. Your history too. Or at least the part you’ve forgotten.”

Before I could ask more, he walked into the tunnel. I followed.

The air grew warm. The walls glowed softly, pulsing like they were alive. Carvings appeared—scenes of people climbing mountains, falling from heights, watching sunsets, transforming into animals, fighting invisible enemies.

Some carvings looked like moments from my own dream—moments I had lived just hours earlier. But the carvings were old, ancient, as if the dream had been lived already by countless others.

We reached a large cavern. A pool of perfectly still water lay in the center. Above it, a circular window in the rock showed the sky—though we were deep underground. The sky visible through it was bright, not night or day, but something in between.

“Look,” the boy said.

Something moved beneath the water. Shapes swirled—memories, moments, perhaps even possible futures. I leaned closer.

Inside the reflection, I saw myself climbing the mountain again—but differently. Older, more certain, with wings that seemed natural, not surprising. Behind me were the monkey-like beings, watching silently, no longer angry but waiting.

As I stared, the reflection shifted.

I saw the aunt, the cousin, the shop, the mansion, the eels, the trash channel, the girls at the gate, the gang of boys, the rules of branches, the boxes of food—all woven together into a pattern that made sense only inside a dream.

And then the pool rippled.

A whisper rose from it:

“You have only seen the beginning.
The mountain remembers those who climb it.”

I stepped back.

The boy turned to me.

“It’s time to go deeper,” he said.
